                    will stop you. It is like the sun - you can't block it: it will shine regardless, if that is what

                        <p>"ChatGPT is an AI language model developed by OpenAI, which is capable of generating
                            human-like
                            text based on the input it is given. The model is trained on a large corpus of text data and
                            can
                            generate responses to questions, summarize long texts, write stories and much more. It is
                            often
                            used in conversational AI applications to simulate a human-like conversation with users."

                        <p>Chatbots have been around for decades, and you might know them best from interacting with any
                            customer service agent over text; often, that's a chatbot. The term chatbot is actually a
                            brutal
                            reimagining of the much more fun "ChatterBot," coined by Michael Mauldin in 1994(Opens in a
                            new
                            tab). But chatbots have come a long way from Maultin's creation of Verbot to OpenAI's
                            ChatGPT.
